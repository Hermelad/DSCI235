## DSCI 235 Final Assignment
### Project Description
As we know covid has had a big impact on the world in the past couple of years. I have found a dataset that contains a lot of information about how covid has impacted the different states in the US. This dataset contains data from January 13, 2020 to March 7, 2021. With this dataset I want to get a better understanding of how covid many have impacted people differently in the different states. During the times where covid cases were at its peak this information would have been very helpful. Although Covid is not a big threat as it was during that time, analyzing this dataset will help us understand some of the trends and the impact it had on everyone. The questions I intend to answer are: 
1. Is the data similar for hospitalization rate, death rate and positive cases in each state?
2. How much has the vaccine impacted the amount of people getting covid? 
3. What is the rate of people getting hospitalized after testing positive?
4. How many people has covid affected in each state and is there a trend in each state?
